# 🤖 ROS 2 Robotic Arm Simulation

This project simulates a modular robotic arm (Arduinobot) using **ROS 2 Foxy**, **Gazebo**, and **ros2_control**. It showcases a complete robot description, control setup, and simulation environment integration — designed to be hardware-ready and extensible for advanced tasks like **additive manufacturing (Direct Energy Deposition)**.

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ **URDF/Xacro-based robot model** with 5 joints (3 for arm, 2 for gripper)
- ✅ Simulated in **Gazebo** using `ros_gz_sim` and `ros_gz_bridge`
- ✅ **ROS 2 Control** integration via `controller_manager` and joint broadcasters
- ✅ Lifecycle-aware ROS 2 launch system with parameterized configs
- ✅ Modular setup with separate launch files for RViz, Gazebo, and control nodes
- ✅ Real-time state feedback, pluginlib debugging, and full system diagnostics
- 🔄 Planned: Extend to simulate **DED (Direct Energy Deposition)** for additive manufacturing workflows

## 🚀 Launch Instructions
Ensure you're using ROS 2 Foxy, have sourced your workspace, and installed all required packages (see dependencies below).

1. Launch in RViz (Robot Model View)
```
ros2 launch arduinobot_description display.launch.py
```
2. Launch in Gazebo Simulation
```
ros2 launch arduinobot_description gazebo.launch.py
```
3. Load and Spawn Controllers
```
ros2 launch arduinobot_controller controller.launch.py
```


## 🧩 Dependencies
ROS 2 Foxy,
ros_gz_sim, ros_gz_bridge
ros2_control, controller_manager
robot_state_publisher, joint_state_publisher_gui
